Motivation for this module
==========================

This node is largely based on the very similar PCP (Profile Complete
Percentage) module that does the same thing, but for user profile
pages only.

This project was born out of the the need to adapt the functionalities
of the PCP module in a Node entity context for a particular client's
project.

After that project, and in the spirit of Drupal and open source,
I figured that the resultant custom module could be useful to some
wider audience, hence this contrib version.
